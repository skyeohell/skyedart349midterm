      style guide
    </h2>
    <P>This website is a parody of websites for kids tv channels.</P>
    <h2>
      color
    </h2>
    <P>The colors mimic logos and themes from kids channels like Disney and YTV. The uncovered website will feature spray paint looking text that will be done in a contrasting red.</P>
    <section class="porple1">1</section>
    <section class="green2">2</section>
    <section class="green1">3</section>
    <section class="red">4</section>
    <p>There will also be a few other bright flat colors in drawings of the fake characters.</P>
    <h2>
    inspiration
    </h2>
    <figure>
    <img src="images/inspo2.png" alt="ytv screenshot">
    <figcaption>The YTV website features dynamic shapes, bright colors, images of its most popular characters, and sections devoted to expanded media of their shows.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
    <img src="images/adultswim.png" alt="adult swim screenshot">
    <figcaption>The adult swim website is an interesting contrast to the YTV website as it focuses on showing the absurdity of their shows and getting you to watch them instead of the kid friendly explorative nature of the YTV site.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2>
    fonts
    </h2>
    <figure>
      <img class="hole" src="images/impact.png" alt="impact">
      <figcaption>The main headings of the website will use impact. It is a readable fun font which works well for a kids website.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <img class="hole" src="images/courier.png" alt="impact">
      <figcaption>The body of the webste will use courier.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2>
    images
    </h2>
    <p>A main chunk of the website will consist of images and graphics for fake kids cartoons that will transform into more explicit imagery. These images will be digitally drawn and will feature cartoony characters with flat colors. On the surface level of the page, the images will be child friendly and very typical cartoon style. The subsurface level of the website will have the same characters depicted in the surface images but in more provocative depictions.</p>
    <h2>
    interaction
    </h2>
    <p>
    Interactions will include a button on corner of page to peel away and reveal real website, expanding sections to reveal information (simple image, hover over image to reveal text and expanded information), Tilting text swings up when hovered to read, and scrolling galleries.
