  <p>Adult animation is more popular than ever. There were over 100 adult animted series released in 2021, a number that doubled from the previous year. Although comedy still dominates this category, accounting for over 60% of series in 2021, it has begun to expand into more genres, and many believe that non-comedy genres are where adult animated shows are shifting. Reboots and spinoffs are also more accessible and accordingly ‘lower-risk’ than live action versions (Cartoon Brew Connect, 2021). </p>
  <p>Although, we really don’t have to look at the numbers to see this growing popularity, as it is evermore present on social media and streaming service advertisements. Companies have finally began to recognize the power of this form of media and whether this expansion is for better or for worse, it is good to see this recognition being made.</p>
  <p>Adult animation allows creators to take swings with shows that they would be unable to do with live action. For example, Big Mouth, a Netflix series which approaches adolescence and puberty in a way that would never work in live action. Another popular example is Bojack Horseman, which uses a talking horse to explore subjects like depression and alcoholism (Guardian News and Media. 2021).</p>
  <p>This genre has existed for a while now, debuting notably with the Simpsons in 1989. 2022 marks the airing of the 34th season of The Simpsons; although most say the quality of the show is not what it used to be, this longevity stands as a testament to the lasting appreciation for animated media targeted at older audiences. Other notable early contenders of the genre include Family Guy and South Park, whose crass humor and social commentary helped normalize this idea of animated media being used in ways beyond children’s entertainment.</p>
  <p>Targeting animation toward an older audience is not just adding dirty jokes and sexual innuendos, as that idea has existed since the 1930s through characters like Betty Boop, whose animated films featured many provocative depictions and sexual themes. Adultifying animation moreso refers to the idea of injecting some intelligence into its ideas. The Simpsons has been the blueprint for this since their first appearance; they have injected intelligence into every aspect of their writing. This means not just tackling meaningful themes of family relationships and alcoholism, but making smart references in its humor. Look, for example, at  season 5’s episode ‘Cape Feare’ which sees Sideshow Bob getting smacked in the face by a rake 8 times in less than 30 seconds; this may be a simple slapstick repeated gag bit on the surface, but we can also look at the wonderful tribute the bit is making to comic excess, which sees a humorus bit repeated to the point that it is funny, then less funny, then not funny, then even violently funnier than before. This idea is a reference to greats such as David Letterman, or Laurel and Hardy trying and failing to repeatedly get a piano up the stairs in Big Business (Seitz & Sepinwall, 2016). This expanded writing allows for a viewership that can focus and process their content instead of taking cartoons as brainless surface level media.

  My plan for my website is to depict somewhat of a parody website for a kids tv channel. Websites like Nickoloden’s nick.com have always been a website for kids who are fans of the company’s tv shows to look at show schedules, play games, and see expanded media for their favorite shows. I hope to present a website that looks similar to that on the surface, but with the click of an icon, the website transforms and reveals a more mature website.
  </p>
  <p>For my home page this will be most likely be shown with the website being ‘trashed’; with onscreen characters transforming from innocent depictions to provocative looks, and graffiti transforming the text onscreen from kid-friendly to adult-oriented, for example, a section reading ‘Just for Kids’ with graffiti style text added to read ‘NOT Just for Kids ANYMORE!’. Sections of the page initially devoted to information about children’s tv shows will transform to display information about adult animated content and its rise in popularity. The schedule page of the website will transform into a timeline of the genre. An expressive timeline of the genre’s popular features will take the place of a schedule depicting fake kids shows. </p>
  <p>I plan on creating a few simple fake kids shows for the surface level of the website. I plan on creating about 6 fake shows with simple graphics to depict them on the website. For the under-the-surface level of the website I will transform some of these characters for more adult depictions. The website will not change from showing kids shows to showing adult shows, but instead change from kids shows, to an adultified version of the same website that displays information and ideas about why this genre is popular and what makes it so good. Although the website will certainly make reference to popular adult animated content, the website will not be specifically devoted to showcasing those shows.</p>
